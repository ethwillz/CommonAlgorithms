/*
  Goal: find bridges in an undirected, connected graph
                â®‘ Any edge that when deleted would increase the num of connected components

  To do this we'll do a modified DFS, during the traversal of each vertex we will
  create a discovery time and a low value corresponding to the sequential time
  when it was discovered and the lowest discovery time its seen through its subtree.

  If the child's DFS tree has not seen a vertex with a smaller discovery time this
  means that the subtree rooted at this child does not have any connection to an
  ancestor of this vertex, so therefore the edge between them is a bridge.
